In a Java-based application under active development by a small team, setting up Continuous Integration (CI) is essential for maintaining code quality and avoiding integration issues. A standard CI pipeline typically includes steps like linting, testing, and building.

For linting, the Java ecosystem offers tools like Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs. These tools help enforce coding standards, detect potential bugs, and maintain code readability. They can be integrated into build tools like Maven or Gradle.

Testing is often done using JUnit for unit tests and Mockito for mocking dependencies. For integration testing, Testcontainers can be used to spin up lightweight database or service containers. Code coverage can be monitored using JaCoCo.

For building, Java developers typically use Maven or Gradle. Both support dependency management and can be configured to run linting and testing tasks automatically before packaging the application.

Aside from Jenkins and GitHub Actions, other CI solutions include GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI, and TeamCity. Each has different strengths; for instance, GitLab CI is tightly integrated with GitLab repositories, while CircleCI offers easy configuration with YAML files and fast container-based builds.

Choosing between self-hosted and cloud-based CI setups depends on factors like team size, security needs, and infrastructure budget. For a small team, a cloud-based solution is usually better due to lower maintenance overhead and easier scalability. However, if the application handles sensitive data or must meet strict compliance standards, a self-hosted setup might be preferred.

To make a final decision, one would need to assess factors like build frequency, runtime, cost limits, security policies, and team expertise.
